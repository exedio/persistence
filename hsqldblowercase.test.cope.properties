# hsqldb 1.8.0

# This is a test database configuration of the
# cope project. It uses lower case table names,
# as MySQL does with option lower_case_table_names
# enabled. This may be useful even without MySQL,
# if the schema has been migrated from or is planned
# to be migrated to MySQL.

# The parameter x-build.driver is used in the cope
