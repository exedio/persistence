TODO for cope

* runtime
	- constraints
		- range (minimum/maximum) for LongField
		- precision (number of fractional digits) for doubles (see PriceField)
		- arbitrary check constraints
	- search API
		- oracle statistics / mysql execution plan
		- group by
	- application triggered Save Points for partial transaction rollback
	- EnumField:
		* allow modification of integers in DB via annotation
		* optionally put strings in DB
	- EnumSetField and EnumMapField should implement Settable
	- Media:
		* maintain charset in Content-Type for texts
		* optionally maintain filename param in Content-Disposition header
		* implement MediaAlias
		* redundantly maintain width/height for images
		* check contentType against body, available in console
			needs before
			- condition DataField.startsWith(byte[])
			- condition Media.contentTypeEquals(String)
		* store text/* gzipped and deliver as such to the browser
	- Editor:
		* preview management
		* persistent previews / staging area
		* resolve conflict for persistent previews
		* preview for images
	- Hash:
		* support a maximum of failed checks
		* support blocking for a short time after a failed check
	- interface Deletable, to allow explicitly deleting items
		otherwise its forbidden.
	- a pattern Range
	- a pattern Replicator
	- Global History / Undo facility for backoffice, that can undo deletes as well.
	- MySQL: warning, if row could exceed 8000 bytes limit
	- implement Comparable
		* Item
		* Day
		* Price
	- implement Serializable
		* items of types without unique java class
		* Type and Feature (for backoffice and ContentEditor sessions)
	- Connection Pool: throw exception, if transaction is not closed when putting back to pool
	- enable clustering
		* persistent modification counters
			- option for disable
			- omit if all fields are final
		* clustered primary key generation
		* remote cache invalidation
		* information in console
		* make IntegerField.defaultToNext cluster-aware
		* make migrations cluster aware
		* test configuration of tomcat
	- move DateField#touch into separate pattern Timestamp
	- FieldListLimited: allow length terminated instead of null terminated as well
	- patterns such as PriceField as function for select and orderBy
	- Cache: store values in three arrays int[], double[], String[] instead of a Map,
		saves lots of objects going through full GC.
		* implement pooling for various classes, especcially when trove LinkedHashMap is done
	- QueryCache:
		* implement similar compact representation as for Cache
		* special handling for empty/singleton results saving memory
	- allow declaring indexes / other schema modification in SQL.
	- trove:
		* implement equivalent of LinkedHashMap, would avoid clean-up sweeps for Cache#stateMaps
		* implement TObjectObjectHashMap, would provide open hashing instead of chained hashing for Cache#queries
	- rethink internal structure of Entity, State, Row
	- allow (fulltext) indexes to be declared in java source code,
		and generate useful finders for index.
	- migrate to Oracle 11 from Oracle 9
		* revisit all oracle-specific code in framework and tests
	- test model:
		* put classes for patterns into separate package
		* separate test model for lib tests and testwebapp (webtests)
		* make small test models for each lib test
	- support JMX for information displayed by ConsoleServlet
* instrument
	- use annotations instead of javadoc tags (such as @cope.initial)
	- localized generated comments
	- instrumentation for modified files only
	- disable/different access modifier for all generated methods
* console
	- allow changing the database connection parameters
	- pager for modification listeners and query cache
	- media stats:
		* for 404 last 10 requests with pathInfo, referrer
		* for 500 last 10 requests with pathInfo, referrer, exception
	- history
		* add stats about modification listeners
	- ensure complete consistency of class/-Type columns
* copernica
	- query designer
	- improve presentation of qualified fields / relation / dynamic type system
	- restrictions
	- save medias on "Save", not on upload
	- use <link rel="prev/next/copyright/home"
	- show warning on website, if account runs with empty/default/bad password
