* Lib
	- constraints
		- range (minimum/maximum) for integers/doubles
		- precision (number of fractional digits) for doubles
		- arbitrary check constraints
	- search API
		- introduce Condition#TRUE/#FALSE and use it for:
			+ empty composite conditions
			+ conditions contradicting constraints
			+ skipping db searches at all
		- oracle statistics
		- group by
	- Transactions: introduce timestamp and use it in
		* Item#touch
		* timestamp of data files
		* list of open transactions in console
	- EnumField:
		* allow modification of integers in DB via cope.properties
		* optionally put strings in DB
	- DataField:
		* write tests for up/downloading data in copernica
	- Media:
		* maintain charset in Content-Type for texts
		* optionally maintain filename param in Content-Disposition header
		* implement MediaAlias
		* redundantly maintain width/height for images
	- move Item#touch into separate pattern Timestamp
	- FieldListLimited: allow length terminated instead of null terminated as well
	- Cache: store values in three arrays int[], double[], String[] instead of a Map,
		saves lots of objects going through full GC.
	- trove:
		* implement equivalent of LinkedHashMap, would avoid clean-up sweeps for Cache#stateMaps
		* implement TObjectObjectHashMap, would provide open hashing instead of chained hashing for Cache#queries
	- allow (fulltext) indexes to be declared in java source code,
		and generate useful finders for index.
	- test model:
		* put classes for patterns into separate package
		* separate test model for lib tests and testwebapp (webtests)
		* make small test models for each lib test
	- support JMX for information displayed by ConsoleServlet
	- implement property database.dontSupport.defineColumnTypes,
		gains a small performance benefit for oracle thin drivers,
		see http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/htdocs/jdbc_faq.htm#06_01
	- write documention
		* support for Defining Column Types on oracle
			http://download-west.oracle.com/docs/cd/B10501_01/java.920/a96654/oraperf.htm#1002524
* Instrumentor
	- localized generated comments
	- instrumentation for modified files only
	- disable/different access modifier for all generated methods
* ConsoleServlet
	- allow changing the database connection parameters
* Copernica
	- query designer
	- improve presentation of qualified fields / relation / dynamic type system
	- restrictions
	- save medias on "Save", not on upload
	- use <link rel="prev/next/copyright/home"
	- show warning on website, if account runs with empty/default/bad password
