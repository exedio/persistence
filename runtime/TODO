TODO for cope runtime

- search API
	- oracle statistics
	- allow accessing features of subtypes of bound types
	- condition DataField.is[Not]Null
		use this on Media for CheckConstraint
	- order by with customizable null low/high
- application triggered Save Points for partial transaction rollback
- EnumField:
	* optionally put strings in DB
- Media:
	* maintain charset in Content-Type for texts
	* optionally maintain filename param in Content-Disposition header
	* implement MediaAlias
	* redundantly maintain width/height for images
	* implement Accept-Ranges - needed for streaming video
- CheckConstraints: make them work with conditions on fields of super type.
- interface Deletable, to allow explicitly deleting items
	otherwise its forbidden.
- Global History / Undo facility for backoffice, that can undo deletes as well.
- MySQL: warning, if row could exceed 8000 bytes limit
- feature reuse with copy() for Order.articleName
	* copy() for all features
- Connection Pool: throw exception, if transaction is not closed when putting back to pool
- enable clustering
	* make revisions cluster aware
	* test configuration of tomcat
- Price
	* use LongField for larger numbers
- Money
	* support currencies with different factors to smaller unit
- move DateField#touch into separate pattern Timestamp
- SetFieldOrdered: SetField with explicit order
- patterns such as PriceField as function for select and orderBy
- Copy Constraint
	* allow non-final fields
	* support DefaultAddress scenario
- allow declaring indexes / other schema modification in SQL.
- use getForeignKeyInfo() etc. from JDBC for verifying dsmf schema
- allow (fulltext) indexes to be declared in java source code,
	and generate useful finders for index.
- test model:
	* put classes for patterns into separate package
	* make small test models for each lib test
- support JMX for information displayed by ConsoleServlet
- separate into own sub-projects:
	* instrumentor

performance / memory consumption
--------------------------------

- Media:
	* store text/* gzipped and deliver as such to the browser
	* https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/rules_intro
		- Cache-Control: public on non-@PreventUrlGuessing
			* for Firefox workaround ?
			* for proxies near client
		- cookieless domain or CDN
		- minify .css and .js
		- put dimensions of images into html or css
	* @PreventUrlGuessing
		- propagate from Media to its MediaFilters
		- do not compute secret in url, but store in database
		- do not put url secret into query parameter, but integrate into url path
- ConnectionPool:
	* replace expensive connection testing on retrieval from pool
		by periodic expiry of connections that have not been used for some time.
	* show information about expired connection / last expiry run in console
- Use auto-increment instead of sequences
- less updating:
	- omit updates, when a setter sets a field to an unchanged value
	- update only columns, that have changed
	- update only tables (in type hierarchy) with changed columns
	This will decrease the size of MySQL binary logs (and similar functions of other RDBMS) as well.
- Batched Updates
	Is a JDBC functionality for reducing round trips to the database.
- ItemCache: store values in three arrays int[], double[], String[] instead of a Map,
	saves lots of objects going through full GC.
	* implement pooling for various classes, especcially when trove LinkedHashMap is done
	* use LRU with guava ComputingMap: http://guava-libraries.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release09/javadoc/com/google/common/collect/MapMaker.html#makeComputingMap%28com.google.common.base.Function%29
- QueryCache:
	* implement similar compact representation as for Cache
	* special handling for empty/singleton results saving memory
	* use LRU with guava ComputingMap: http://guava-libraries.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release09/javadoc/com/google/common/collect/MapMaker.html#makeComputingMap%28com.google.common.base.Function%29
- compress strings in cache, using special algorithm such as Snappy.
- ActivationCache
	cache instance of subclasses of Item independently of ItemCache,
	even if the model is not yet connected
- trove:
	* implement equivalent of LinkedHashMap, would avoid clean-up sweeps for Cache#stateMaps
	* implement TObjectObjectHashMap, would provide open hashing instead of chained hashing for Cache#queries
- Type Columns
	are columns "class" for polymorphic Types and columns "xxxType" for polymorphic ItemFields
	- in memory: use cacheIdTransiently instead
	- in database: use a number explicitly defined by annotation
- rethink internal structure of Entity, State, Row
- special handling of searches by unique constraints, bypassing QueryCache
