/**
 * Specifies a http redirect (moved permanently) to
 * a {@link MediaPath}.
 * <p>
 * Common usage is to maintain old urls after renaming a {@link MediaPath}.
 * For instance, if there is a media <tt>picture</tt>:
 *
 * <pre>
 * static final Media picture = new Media();
 * </pre>
 * and this media is renamed to <tt>image</tt>,
 * then old urls created by <tt>picture</tt>
 * can be supported like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @RedirectFrom("picture")}
 * static final Media image = new Media();
 * </pre>
