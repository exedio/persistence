/**
 * ChangeHooks allow to listen to changes of persistent data.
 * They are registered via
 * {@link ModelBuilder#changeHooks(ChangeHook.Factory...) ModelBuilder.changeHooks}
 * when creating the model.
 * Registering hooks later is not supported.
 * <p>
 * Methods of hooks are called synchronously when the change actually occurs,
 * by the thread that does the change.
 * If a method of a hook fails with an exception,
 * that exception is "thrown through" to the call causing the change.
 * If you want to postpone your action until the current transaction commits,
 * use either
 * {@link Model#addPreCommitHookIfAbsent(Runnable) pre}- or
 * {@link Model#addPostCommitHookIfAbsent(Runnable) post}-commit hooks.
 * <p>
 * Note that any <i>new</i> change to persistent data (i.e. other than
 * returning modified {@code setValues}) done in one of the methods will
 * cause this hook to be called again.
 * Without care you may end up with infinite recursion.
 * <p>
 * <b>Synchronization</b><br>
 * There is only one instance of the ChangeHook for each model,
 * and calls to ChangeHooks are not synchronized.
 * If multiple threads concurrently change persistent data,
 * then methods of this hook are called concurrently.
 * <p>
 * It is highly recommended to override {@link Object#toString() toString}
 * with an informative message about the hook.
 * This message is returned by {@link Model#getChangeHookString()}.
 *
