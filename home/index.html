			COPE provides a persistence layer for Java.
			It allows you to specify the persistent schema
			with simple constructs within your java source code.
			No XML files need to be written.
			Everything else, such as setting up database tables,
			choosing datatypes for persistent fields,
			loading and writing objects etc is done for you.
			COPE does also provide a search facility,
			which allows to write complex queries using java objects,
			providing type safety at compile-time.
		</div>
		<div>
			COPE is open source software and available under the
			<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php">GNU&nbsp;Lesser&nbsp;General&nbsp;Public&nbsp;License</a>.
			For getting started with COPE and as a template for your own projects
			there is a simple demo application available under the
			<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">The&nbsp;MIT&nbsp;License</a>.

		<h3>Downloads</h3>
		<div>
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=152867">Downloads</a>
			are hosted on sourceforge.
		</div>
		<div>
			The development process of COPE is strongly influenced by the ideas of
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming">Extreme&nbsp;Programming</a>.
			It heavily relies on
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Automated Continuous Integration</a>.
		</div>
		<div>
			Therefore, releases published on sourceforge do not
			carry any explicit version number.
			Instead each release is named after the build number assigned by the
			<a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">cruisecontrol</a>
			server that built this release.
			Each build is subject to extensive automated unit
			testing on all supported databases
			(currently Hsqldb, Mysql 4+5 and Oracle 9).
