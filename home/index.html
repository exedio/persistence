		<h1>COPE</h1>
		<div>Cope with Object Persistence</div>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<div>
			COPE provides a persistence layer for Java.
			It allows you to specify the persistent schema
			with simple constructs within your java source code.
			No XML files need to be written.
			Everythings else, such as setting up database tables,
			choosing datatypes for persistent fields,
			loading and writing objects etc is done for you.
			COPE does also provide a search facility,
			which allows to write complex queries using java objects,
			providing type safety at compile-time.
		</div>
		<div>
			COPE is open source software and available under the
			GNU Lesser General Public License.
			For getting started with COPE and as a template for your own projects
			there is a simple demo application available under the The MIT License.
			Downloads are hosted on sourceforge.
