			This trail shows you how to query your data with COPE.
			If you are familiar with SQL,
			you will recognize it's features within the syntax of COPE queries.
			However, you will never directly write SQL,
			nor any other text based query language.
			This will show you most common mistakes as compile-time errors,
			and it will completely remove any chance of
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a>.
		</div>
		<h3>Simple Query</h3>
		<div>
			First we define a simple example model
			consisting of one persistent class only:
		</div>
<pre>
class Customer extends Item
{
   static final StringAttribute email =
       new StringAttribute();
   static final IntegerAttribute loginCounter =
       new IntegerAttribute();
}
</pre>
		<div>
			Lets start with a simple query searching for all instances of
			this class:
		</div>
<pre>
List&lt;Customer&gt; allCustomers =
   Customer.TYPE.search();
</pre>
		<div>
			Note, that the static final field <tt>Customer.TYPE</tt> is
			generated by the cope instrumentor.
			Compiling this statement does not cause an "unchecked warning",
			the return type of search is really a <tt>List&lt;Customer&gt;</tt>
		</div>
		<div>
			If you put the code above into class <tt>Customer</tt>,
			you can write even shorter:
		</div>
<pre>
List&lt;Customer&gt; allCustomers = TYPE.search();
</pre>
		<div>
			For brevity we will assume, that all the examples below are
			located in class <tt>Customer</tt>.
		</div>
		<h3>Conditions</h3>
		<div>
			Conditions restrict the number of items found by a query.
			This is equivalent to the "where clause" in SQL.
			Lets search for the customer with a certain email address:
		</div>
<pre>
TYPE.search(email.equal("cope@exedio.com"));
</pre>
		<div>
			For a "like condition" write:
		</div>
<pre>
TYPE.search(email.like("cope@exedio.%"));
</pre>
		<div>
			which is equivalent to:
		</div>
<pre>
TYPE.search(email.startsWith("cope@exedio."));
</pre>
		<div>
			Of course searching works for integer attributes as well.
			Here a query, that searches for customers,
			that have logged in at least 8 times:
		</div>
<pre>
TYPE.search(loginCounter.greaterOrEqual(8));
</pre>
		<div>
			In contrast to the queries above,
			all the following queries will not compile:
		</div>
<pre>
TYPE.search(email.equal(8));
TYPE.search(loginCounter.greaterOrEqual("cope@exedio.com"));
TYPE.search(loginCounter.like("cope@exedio.%"));
</pre>
		<div>
			The first one tries to compare a string attribute to an integer literal.
			The second query compares an integer attribute to a string attribute.
			The third uses the operator "like" on an integer attribute instead of a string attribute.
		</div>
		<h3>Sorting</h3>
		<div>
		<div>
			Here again a query, that searches for customers,
			that have logged in more than 8 times,
			but now sorted by their email adresses:
		</div>
<pre>
TYPE.search(loginCounter.greaterOrEqual(8), email, true);
</pre>
		<div>
			The third parameter specifies accending order.
			Use <tt>false</tt> to order descendingly.
		</div>
		<div>
			If you want to order by multiple attributes,
			you have to use an explicit query for the first time.
			This looks like this:
		</div>
<pre>
Query&lt;Customer&gt; q =
   TYPE.newQuery(loginCounter.greaterOrEqual(8));
q.addOrderBy(loginCounter);
q.addOrderByDescending(email);
List&lt;Customer&gt; customers = q.search();
</pre>
		<div>
			This query finds all customers,
			which have logged in at least 8 times,
			sorted by the number of their logins ascendingly
			and their email adress descendingly.
		<div>
			Note, that all the methods <tt>Type.search(...)</tt> in the examples before
			use an instance of <tt>Query</tt> in their implementation as well.
			They are convenience methods for the most common and simple queries.
		</div>
		<h3>Limits</h3>
		<div>
			Sometimes you want to fetch just a part of the result of a query.
			This is commonly needed for paging.
			The following query gets the third page of a list of all customers,
			which have logged in at least 8 times.
			Each page contains 10 customers:
		</div>
<pre>
Query&lt;Customer&gt; q =
   TYPE.newQuery(loginCounter.greaterOrEqual(8));
q.setLimit(20, 10);
List&lt;Customer&gt; customers = q.search();
</pre>
		<div>
			Sometimes you may just want to have the first element of the result.
			Then you would probably write something like this:
		</div>
<pre>
Query&lt;Customer&gt; q =
   TYPE.newQuery(loginCounter.greaterOrEqual(8));
q.setLimit(0, 1);
List&lt;Customer&gt; customers = q.search();
</pre>
		<div>
			After such a one-line-only query,
			there often some code like this:
		</div>
<pre>
if(customers.size()==0)
   return null;
else if(customers.size()==0)
   return customers.get(0);
else
   throw new RuntimeException("oops");
</pre>
		<div>
			There is a convenience method <tt>searchSingleton</tt>,
			which avoids writing such code over and over again:
		</div>
<pre>
Query&lt;Customer&gt; q =
   TYPE.newQuery(loginCounter.greaterOrEqual(8));
q.setLimit(0, 1);
return q.searchSingleton();
</pre>
		<div>
			This method is useful, whenever you are sure,
			that the result set can have at most one element.
			This happens if
			you use limits as above or
			you restrict your query to match a <i>unique</i> attribute or
			when using <i>aggregators</i> as explained below.
		</div>
