CHANGELOG for cope

This file lists all changes relevant for the user - especially all
API changes and new features recommended for most users. The log may
omit bug fixes.
The items are sorted inversely, i.e. lastest items are on top

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* reorganized creation and activation of items,
	breaks backwards API compatibility
	heavily affects instrumented code !
	- Type.newItem does not invoke creation constructor anymore,
		this breaks preCreate constructs
		use a static method "SetValue[] beforeNewCopeItem(SetValue[])" instead
		search for @cope.generic.constructor none
	- renamed Item.postCreate() to afterNewCopeItem()
		the compiler will help you, if you have your @Override annotations in place
	- renamed instrumentor tag @cope.reactivation.constructor to @cope.activation.constructor
		this is very rarly used
	- reactivation constructor changed
		+ new signature instead of 
			Item(com.exedio.cope.util.ReactivationDummy, int[, Type]) is now
			Item(com.exedio.cope.ActivationParameters)
		+ in Item is now protected instead of public
	- removed creation constructor Item(SetValue[], Type)
		use Type.newItem instead
* make Type.This a top-level class
	this breaks backwards API compatibility, but is likely to affect a generic backoffice only
* do not use BackingItem for DynamicModel anymore
	this breaks backwards API compatibility, but is likely to affect a generic backoffice only
	affects instrumented code
* renamed Type.hasUniqueJavaClass() to isJavaClassExclusive()
* deprecated constructors of Model not using Revisions
* replaced Model.isRevisionEnabled() and getRevisionNumber() by getRevisions()
	this breaks backwards API compatibility, but is unlikely to affect normal projects
* renamed dsmf driver to dialect
	this breaks backwards API compatibility, but is unlikely to affect normal projects
* moved info classes into separate package
	this breaks backwards API compatibility, but is unlikely to affect normal projects
* removed cope live editor from exedio-cope.jar, it is now it's own project
* deprecated empty constructor of Schedule, provide a Locale instead
* subclasses of MediaPath do not get the url extension anymore
* MediaPath got new method getNamedURL, with additional parameter for setting the "name" of the media
* Console History puts date first in unique constraints
	- makes purging faster
	- affect persistent schema of the history
		you have to drop the old constraints and create the new constraints
* renamed UniqueConstraint.searchUnique to search
	affects instrumented code
* Console allows checking Media ContentType against body using magic numbers
* rename Media.contentTypeMajor to contentTypeSub
* Media with default Content-Type or major Content-Type do restrict the
	CharSet of the StringField storing the Content-Type. You may need to adjust
	the persistent schema (adding new check constraints) and/or adjust your data.
* add pattern Range
* Editor provides LOGIN_PATH_INFO
* Editor provides isBordersEnabled()
	use  this instead of isLoggedIn() for triggering css import
* Interrupter from exedio-cope-util.jar is used
	- affects Dispatcher, Schedule, PasswordRecovery
* cope now depends on new project copeutil
	- add exedio-cope-util.jar where trove.jar is used as well
* add Schedule.enabled, adds new columns to schema, should be initialized with "true"
* changed url of content editor from contentEditorLogin.html or copeContentEditor.html to copeLiveEdit.html
* in contentEditor.css remove any styles related to contentEditorBar
* for content editor, Editor.writeHead must be called in html head
* renamed EditorPreview to Draft
* added SHAHash as a replacement for MD5Hash, which is no longer secure
* field for storing hashes uses algorithm for name,
	i.e. passwordHash becomes passwordMD5
	affects instrumented methods and persistent schema
* support for
	<taskdef resource="com/exedio/cope/instrument/ant.properties" classpath="lib/exedio-cope-instrument.jar" />
* Editor
	- put classes into separate package com.exedio.cope.editor
	- make Login a top-level interface and rename it to Session
* updated cops library to build.54, do get it from cops project now
* updated jspm library to build.14, added check.version target to getlib.xml
* added Query.emptyResult()
