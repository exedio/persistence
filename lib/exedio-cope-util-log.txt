CHANGELOG for cope util

This file lists all changes relevant for the user - especially all
API changes and new features recommended for most users. The log may
omit bug fixes.
The items are sorted inversely, i.e. latest items are on top

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Properties.Field becomes final, its subclasses are dropped.
	This breaks backwards API compatibility.
	Update copeconsole to build 7003 at least, otherwise tabs Connect / Connect Tokens will be broken.
* Properties#fieldMap and Properties.MapField dropped.
	This breaks backwards API compatibility.
* Properties do support Duration with plain milliseconds - useful for migration
* Properties.Source#reload() and Sources#reloadable added.
* ProxyPropertiesSource added.
* Properties#getField(key) added.
* JobContext#deferOrStopIfRequested, #requestsDeferral and #sleepAndStopIfRequested added.
	This breaks backwards API compatibility.
* JobContext#requestedToStop dropped.
	Was deprecated some long time ago.
	This breaks backwards API compatibility.
* @ServiceProperties added
* Properties#valueService added
* Properties#valueMessageDigest added
* Properties#getOrphanedKeys added
* Stricter CharSet consistency checks: Areas of valid characters must be separated by at least one invalid character.
	If you use com.exedio.cope.pattern.Media, make sure you have at least cope build 9410 - otherwise instantiation
	of Media features (and hence model setup) will fail.
* CharSet.EMAIL is now deprecated, use one of CharSet.EMAIL_* instead
  (one-to-one replacement is CharSet.EMAIL_RESTRICTIVE)
* Properties: workaround for javac problem with method value(String, Factory):
		error: reference to value is ambiguous
	Use new method valnp instead.
* Properties do support Duration
* Day#toLocalDate/from(LocalDate) added
* requires JDK 1.8.0_60
* Properties do support enum, added
	value(String key, Class<Enum> valueClass) and
	value(String key, Enum defaultValue)
* added ivy configurations 'sources' and 'changelog'
	sources and changelog won't be included in 'runtime' config per default anymore
* Properties#newException added
* TimeZoneStrict added
* requires JDK 1.7u6
* IllegalPropertiesException added
* bugfix: PrefixSource nested twice did nest the wrong way,
	did also affect PropertiesField.
* CharSet#getRegularExpression escapes non-ASCII and control characters
* CharSet#isSubsetOfAscii added
* bugfix: Day requires TimeZone where needed
	old API was deprecated
* bugfix: Day#hashCode produces distinct values for days like 2/5/2005 and 5/2/2005
* Pool will not fail anymore, if Factory#isValidOnPut returns false.
	Instead of throwing an IllegalArgumentException (invalid on put)
	the pooled object is silently dropped. Any logging should be done by
	isValidOnPut itself.
	This breaks backwards API compatibility.
* Properties#fieldFile becomes mandatory
	This breaks backwards API compatibility.

* bugfix: Pool get counter is incremented even if create fails
