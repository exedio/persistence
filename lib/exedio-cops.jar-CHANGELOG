CHANGELOG for cops

This file lists all changes relevant for the user - especially all
API changes and new features recommended for most users. The log may
omit bug fixes.
The items are sorted inversely, i.e. lastest items are on top

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* PropertiesServlet supports getTests
* fix endless redirection loop in Cop#redirectToCanonical, if
	addParameter(String, Cop) is used with parameters containing non-safe
	characters.
* change return type of Cop#needsSecure() from Boolean to boolean.
	
	Forcing http is no longer supported because of numerous problems.
	THIS CHANGE IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE, YOU MUST ADJUST YOUR CODE !
	
	Take care, because the mapping between old and new return values of
	needsSecure may easily lead to mistakes! Boolean.FALSE is *not*
	replaced by false! See the table below:
	
		meaning       | old           | new
		-----------------------------------------------
		https         | Boolean.TRUE  | true
		http          | Boolean.FALSE | <not supported>
		any (default) | null          | false
	
	If you do not override needsSecure(), you don't have to do anything.
