# This is the hsqldb dialect configuration

# If you want to compile other dialects as
# well, you have to create similar files
# in this directory. The base name of such
# a file ("hsqldb" here) must correspond to
# the source path of the dialect classes
# ("lib/hsqldbsrc" here). The property "jar"
# specifies the jar file of the jdbc driver
# within the lib directory.
